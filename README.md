# Strategy-Optimization-Using-Markov-Decision-Processes-
 This project uses a Markov Decision Process to optimize salmon fishing for long-term sustainability and profit. It employs Value Iteration and Policy Iteration to find optimal strategies, using states from empty to high and actions to fish or not. Implemented in Python, it ensures a sustainable balance with a 0.9 discount factor.
