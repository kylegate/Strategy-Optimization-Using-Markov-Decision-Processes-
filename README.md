# Strategy-Optimization-Using-Markov-Decision-Processes-
 This project uses a Markov Decision Process to optimize salmon fishing for long-term sustainability and profit. It employs Value Iteration and Policy Iteration to find optimal strategies, using states from empty to high and actions to fish or not. Implemented in Python, it ensures a sustainable balance with a 0.9 discount factor.

**Overview **

This project models salmon fishing decisions using a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to maximize profitability while ensuring long-term sustainability. With states ranging from empty to high salmon populations and actions like fishing or not fishing, the MDP approach helps determine optimal strategies to balance rewards and sustainability.

**Tools and Technologies**

Python: Core programming language for implementing the MDP.
MDP Libraries: Used for creating the MDP model, defining state transitions, and computing optimal policies.
Value Iteration and Policy Iteration: Algorithms to derive optimal value functions and policies for decision-making.

**Results and Insights**

By using Value Iteration and Policy Iteration with a discount factor of 0.9, we identify the optimal policies to maximize long-term returns from salmon fishing while maintaining a sustainable population. The results guide decisions to avoid overfishing and ensure balanced harvesting, reducing the risk of depletion.
